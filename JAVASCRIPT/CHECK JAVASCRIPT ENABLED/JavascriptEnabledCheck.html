			IF YOU WANT TO SEPARATE USERS WHOSE JAVASCRIPT IS ENABLED..FROM THOSE WHO DONT HAVE IS TO USE REDIRECT SCRIPT
			Another way of checking Javascript is using a Redirect Script to make it 
			Compulsory for people to enable javascript on their browsers
			Here suppose we go to a page
			<A HREF="RedirectCheck.html">Click on this page to go to Redirect page</A>
