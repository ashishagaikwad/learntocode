<p><b>In addition to the standard set of event attributes (defined by the W3C), Microsoft introduced a wide variety of additional events that may be captured and used in any client-side scripting techniques. Note that if you do use these events, they may not be supported by any browser other than Internet Explorer, therefore you are strongly advised to use only the approved event attributes to ensure cross-browser compatibility.</b></p>
