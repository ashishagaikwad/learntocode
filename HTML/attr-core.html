<h3>EXPLANATION: </h3>
<h4>ID</h4>
<p>The id attribute provides a unique identifier for an element within the document. It may be used by an a element to create a hyperlink to this particular element.

This identifier may also be used in CSS code as a hook that can be used for styling purposes, or by JavaScript code (via the Document Object Model, or DOM) to make changes or add behavior to the element by referencing its unique id.

Note that the id attribute cannot be applied to the following elements:

base
head
html
meta
script
style
title

example:
<span id="thisspan">A uniquely identifiable element.</span>
</p>
<h4>CLASS</h4>
<p>
	While the name of an element specifies its type, the class attribute lets you assign to it one or more subtypes. These subtypes may then be used in CSS code for styling purposes, or by JavaScript code (via the Document Object Model, or DOM) to make changes, or add behavior, to elements belonging to a particular subtype.

Note that the class attribute cannot be applied to the following elements:

base
basefont
head
html
meta
param
script
style
title
</p>
<h4>DIR:</h4>
<p>
	The dir attribute tells the browser the direction in which the displayed text is intended to be read. The browser will render text from left to right by default, but as with the lang attribute, you’ll need to override the intended reading direction if you’re including text that runs in the opposite direction (for example, Arabic or Hebrew).
</p>
<h4>LANG:</h4>
<p>
	The lang attribute is used to identify the language of the content on a web page, when it’s applied to the html element, or within a given section on a web page, when it’s applied to a div, span, a, or any other element that may contain content in a language that differs from that used on the rest of the page.
</p>
<h4>STYLE:</h4>
<p>
Used for applying inline styles.

Note that the style attribute cannot be applied to the following elements:
base
basefont
head
html
meta
param
script
style
title
</p>

<h4>TITLE</h4>
<p>The title attribute allows the author to provide extra information about any element on a page. Typically, this attribute’s content is rendered as a tooltip that appears when the user hovers the cursor over the element to which the title is applied.</p>

<h4>xml:lang</h4>
<p>The xml:lang attribute is identical in its usage and purpose to the lang attribute, but with one difference: it must be applied within documents that use an XHTML doctype.</p>
