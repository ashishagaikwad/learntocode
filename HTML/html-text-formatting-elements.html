<p>This is an abbrevation of <abbr title="synchronization">sync</abbr> Please put your mouse on word to view it</p>
<p>This is an acronym of <acronym title="Javascript">JS</acronym> Please put your mouse on word to view it. Whereas the abbr element is used to describe any abbreviated phrase, acronym is used only where the phrase comprises initial letters that make a word.</p>
<p>address:used to indicate the contact point for the document in which it appears</p>
<p>This is an example of <b>bold</b> element</p>
<p>basefont: DEPRECATED The basefont element was originally devised as a mechanism for resetting the default size for normal text using the seven font sizes that were available in early versions of HTML.The basefont element is also deprecated, having been removed from HTML 4</p>

<p>bdo:reversing the direction of text enclosed between the opening <bdo> and closing </bdo> tags. A palindrome is a word, like 'kayak,' that appears
    exactly the same when all the letters are reversed
        <bdo dir="rtl">Canoe</bdo>, it seems, is not a
    palindrome.</p>

<p>The big element is a text formatting control that increases the enclosed text by one size increment, based on the old HTML font sizes 1 through 7. Each nested big element will further increase the size by one increment.Example: <big>big<big>bigger<big>Even More Bigger</big></big></big></p>
<p>blink: DEPRECATED</p>
<P>center: DEPRECATED / NOT SUPPORTED</P>
<p>cite : to identify the contained text as a reference to another source, be that a book, a play, a periodical publication, or even another web page or site Below is an example</p>

<p>Kurt Vonnegut, author of such classics as <cite>Slaughterhouse
    5</cite>, <cite>Player Piano</cite>, and <cite>The Sirens of
    Titan</cite>, will be sorely missed by the literary world.</p>

<p>code: The code element’s purpose is to identify computer code</p>    
<p>To indicate a reference to a printed work, you'd use the <code>cite</code> attribute as follows: <code>&lt;p&gt;My favorite book is &lt;cite&gt;The Two
Towers&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>comment: The comment element is a non-standard and little-supported element that’s used to add comments to markup</p>
<p>del : The del element is used to indicate a change that saw the author delete content which appeared in an earlier version of a document.<del datetime="2015-3-2  23:31:05Z">this is a deleted text</del>Whether a del element is determined to be inline or block level depends on the context in which it’s used. If the del is an immediate child of body (with a Strict Doctypes declaration), it’s a block-level element. If it’s a child of a p element, it’s deemed to be an inline element.</p>
<p>Bernie enjoyed nothing more than a <del
    cite="http://berniesworld.com/drag.html"
    datetime="2007-11-05T23:31:05Z">night out on the town at his
    favorite drag queen show</del> <ins
    cite="http://berniesworld.com/drag.html"
    datetime="2007-11-05T23:33:32Z">quiet night in with a warm cup of
    cocoa</ins></p>
    <p>cite attribute in del gives us the reason why the del element was used to change the page content is explained in an external document. In such cases, you can use the cite attribute to point users to that document.</p>

    <p>The dfn element is used to identify the defining instance of a term—that is, the point in the document at which a given term (most probably an industry-specific word, or jargon of some kind) is first explained. Some, but not all, browsers will render the content inside the dfn element in italics.example : <dfn>Coding</dfn> is used to develop programs Here coding word is defined in italics</p>

    <p>em: The em element is used to emphasize text content, and displays in italics in all current browsers. It provides semantic meaning about the text it contains, effectively saying,<em>this text is slightly more important than other text</em> here</p>

    <P>ins: The ins element is used to indicate a change to the document that saw the author insert content which wasn’t included in an earlier version. it has two attributes cite and datetime. Example : <del>I am a bad boy</del><ins>Sorry i mean to say i am a good boy</ins></P>

    <p>font: DEPRECATED</p>

    <p>kbd: </p>
    p>Hold down <kbd>CTRL</kbd>, <kbd>ALT</kbd>, and <kbd>DELETE</kbd>,
    then select Task Manager</p>
    <p>marquee : is a way of moving text. but considered unfriendly as text is not easily readable</p>
    <marquee>this text is used in marquee. but dont use it </marquee>

    <p>nobr : DEPRECATED . NON STANDARD/ PROPRIETORY ATTRIBUTE The nobr element is a proprietary (as in not based on any standard) one that was used to define sections of text that the browser should not allow to wrap, regardless of what may happen
    	Example:
    </p>
    <p>Our telephone number is <nobr>0800 123 123 123</nobr>.Our telephone number is <nobr>0800 123 123 123</nobr>.Our telephone number is <nobr>0800 123 123 123</nobr>.Our telephone number is <nobr>0800 123 123 123</nobr>.</p>

    <p>noscript: The noscript element has but one purpose: to provide content for people accessing the web page with a browser that either doesn’t support client-side scripting, or that has had its script support disabled by the user.</p>
    <p>plaintext: DEPRECATED</p>

    <pre>
    	this
    	is pre 
    	formatted 
    	text and it preserves spaces 
    	and line breaks
    </pre>
    
    <p>q: q element is used for inline quotations.
    	Heck, even Bill Gates is quoted as saying <q>We need
    Microformats,</q> which can only be a good thing for the cause.</p>
    <p>rb,rbc,rp,rt,rtc,ruby : DONT HAVE BROWSER SUPPORT</p>
    <p>s: DEPRECATED.</p>
    <p><s>The guy is a fool.</s> The guy is an absolute genius. What was I thinking?</p>

    <p>SAMP: If the browser spits out an error message such as
    <samp>HTTP 404 - File not found</samp>,
    you may simply have typed the address incorrectly.</p>

    <p>small: NOT DEPRECATED BUT LEAST USED .Mark tried to get out of buying a round of drinks by getting
    progressively quieter as he talked: "Right, I'm off to stretch my
    legs and then get a bag of peanuts ... <small>back in a minute ...
    <small>everyone OK for a drink?</small></small></p>

    <p>hello i am using <span>span</span> element</p>
    <p>strike: NOT VALID.used to strike line between text</p>

    <p>this is a <strong>strong</strong> word</p>
    <p>hi this is my<sup>superscript</sup> and this is my <sub>subscript</sub></p>

    <p>tt: teletype NOT RECOMMENDED render as teletype in old computers uses courier typeface but can be rendered by using monospace font using CSS</p>

    <p>var: The var element is used to indicate that the text is a variable and shouldn’t be taken literally. Instead, it’s a placeholder where the contents should be replaced with your own value.
    </p>
    <p>To forward incoming calls to another extension, press 
    <kbd>* 21 * <var>extension</var> #</kbd>.</p>

    <p>wbr: NON STANDARD ELEMENT used for word break.</p>
