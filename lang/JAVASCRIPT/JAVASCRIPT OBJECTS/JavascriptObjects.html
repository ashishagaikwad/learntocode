        <h3>
          JS Objects
        </h3>
        <h4>
          What is an Object?
        </h4>
        <p>
          An object is an unordered list of primitive data types (and sometimes reference data types) that is stored as a series of name-value pairs. Each item in the list is called a property (functions are called methods).          
        </p>

        <h4>
          Reference Data Type and Primitive Data Types
        </h4>
        <p>
          One of the main differences between reference data type and primitive data types is reference data type’s value is stored as a reference, it is not stored directly on the variable, as a value, as the primitive data types are. For example:
        </p>
        <script>
          var person = "kobe";
          var anotherperson = person;//anotherperson = value of the person
          person = "ashish";//value of person changed
          console.log(anotherperson);//kobe
          console.log(person);//ashish
        </script>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that even though we changed person to “ashish,” the anotherPerson variable still retains the value that person had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare the primitive data saved-as-value demonstrated above with the save-as-reference for objects:
        </p>
        <script>
          var person1 = {name: "ashish"};
          var anotherPerson1 = person1;
          person1.name = "pratiksha";
          console.log(anotherPerson1.name);//bryant​
          console.log(person1.name); // Bryant
        </script>
        <p>
          In this example, we copied the person object to anotherPerson, but because the value in person was stored as a reference and not an actual value, when we changed the person.name property to “pratiksha” the anotherPerson reflected the change because it never stored an actual copy of it’s own value of the person’s properties, it only had a reference to it.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Object Data Properties Have Attributes
        </h4>
        <p>
          Each data property (object property that store data) has not only the name-value pair, but also 3 attributes (the three attributes are set to true by default):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Configurable Attribute: </em> Specifies whether the property can be deleted or changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Enumerable: </em> Specifies whether the property can be returned in a for/in loop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Writable: </em>Specifies whether the property can be changed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        

        <h4>Creating Objects</h4>
        <p>
          These are the two common ways to create objects:      
        </p>        
        <ul>
          <li>Object Literals</li>
          <li>Object Constructor</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>1. Object Literals</h5>
        <p>
          The most common and, indeed, the easiest way to create objects is with the object literal described here:
        </p>
        <script>
          //This is an empty object initialized using the object literal notation
          var myBooks = {};

          //This is an object with 4 items again using object literal
          var mango  = {
            color:"yellow",
            shape:"round",
            sweetness:8,

            howSweetAmI:function(){
              console.log("Hmm Hmm Good");
            }
          }

          //Using functions defined in the objects
          mango.howSweetAmI();
        </script>

        <h5>2. Object Constructor</h5>
        <p>
           The second most common way to create objects is with Object constructor. A constructor is a function used for initializing new objects, and you use the new keyword to call the constructor.
        </p>
        <script>
          var mango = new Object();
          mango.color = "yellow";
          mango.shape = "round";
          mango.sweetness = 8;

          mango.howSweetAmI = function() {
            console.log("I am very sweet");
          }

          //checking if the function is working
          mango.howSweetAmI();
        </script>

        <p>
          Objects can contain any other data type, including Numbers, Arrays, and even other Objects.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
          Practical Patterns for Creating Objects
        </h4>
        <p>
          For simple objects that may only ever be used once in your application to store data, the two methods used above would suffice for creating objects.          
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you have an application that displays fruits and detail about each fruit. All fruits in your application have these properties: color, shape, sweetness, cost, and a showName function. It would be quite tedious and counterproductive to type the following every time you want to create a new fruit object.          
        </p>
        <script>
        var mangoFruit = {
        color:"yellow",
        sweetness:8,
        fruitName:"Mango",
        nativeToLand:["South America","Central America"],
        showName:function(){
          console.log("This is"+this.fruitName);
        },
        nativeTo:function(){
        this.nativeToLand.forEach(function(eachCountry){console.log("Grown in:"+eachCountry);});}}
        </script>       

        <p>
          If you have 10 fruits, you will have to add the same code 10 times. And what if you had to make a change to the nativeTo function? You will have to make the change in 10 different places. Now extrapolate this to adding objects for members on a website and suddenly you realized the manner in which we have created objects so far is not ideal objects that will have instances, particularly when developing large applications.          
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve these repetitive problems, software engineers have invented patterns (solutions for repetitive and common tasks) to make developing applications more efficient and streamlined.          
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are two common patterns for creating objects. If you have done the Learn JavaScript Properly course, you would have seen the lessons in the Code Academy used this first pattern frequently:          
        </p>

        <h4>
          1. Constructor Pattern for Creating Objects
        </h4>
        <script>
          function Fruit (theColor,theSweetness,theFruitName,theNativeToLand) {
            this.color=theColor;
            this.sweetness=theSweetness;
            this.fruitName=theFruitName;
            this.nativeToLand=theNativeToLand;
            this.showName=function() {
                console.log("This is a "+this.fruitName);
              }
            this.nativeTo=function() {
              this.nativeToLand.forEach(function(eachCountry) {
                console.log("Grown in: "+eachCountry);
              });
            }
          }

          //With this pattern in place, it is very easy to create all sorts of fruits. Thus:

          var mangoFruit=new Fruit("Yellow",8,"Mango",["South America","Central America","West America"]);
          mangoFruit.showName();//This is a Mango
          mangoFruit.nativeTo();
          //Grown in:South America
          //Grown in:Central America
          //Grown in:West America

          var pineappleFruit=new Fruit("Brown",5,"Pineapple",["United States"]);
          pineappleFruit.showName();//This is a Pineapple
          pineappleFruit.nativeTo();
        </script>

        <h4>Prototype Pattern for Creating Objects</h4>

        <h3>Problems and their Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          Property names can be a string or a number, but if the property name is a number, it has to be accessed with the bracket notation.
        </p>
        <script>
          var ageGroup = {20: "Children",30: "Adult", 100:"Very Old"};
          //console.log(ageGroup.30); // This will throw an error​

          //This is how you will access the value of the property 30, to get value "Children"​​          
          console.log(ageGroup["30"]); // Children​
        </script>
